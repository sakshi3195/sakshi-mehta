			<h2>History</h2>

The recipe for the soft drink Pepsi was first developed in the 1880s by Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist and industrialist from New Bern, North Carolina. He coined the name "Pepsi-Cola" in 1898. As the cola developed in popularity, he created the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1902 and registered a patent for his recipe in 1903.[5] The Pepsi-Cola Company was first incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1919.[6] The company went bankrupt in 1931 and on June 8 of that year, the trademark and syrup recipe were purchased by Charles Guth who owned a syrup manufacturing business in Baltimore, Maryland.

<p>BUISNESS DIVISIONS</p>

<p>COMPETITION</p>
The Coca-Cola Company has historically been considered PepsiCo's primary competitor in the beverage market,[27] and in December 2005, PepsiCo surpassed The Coca-Cola Company in market value for the first time in 112 years since both companies began to compete. In 2009, The Coca-Cola Company held a higher market share in carbonated soft drink sales within the U.S.[28] In the same year, PepsiCo maintained a higher share of the U.S. refreshment beverage market, however, reflecting the differences in product lines between the two companies.
